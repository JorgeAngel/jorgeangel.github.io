I'm as postdoctoral research fellow at the Colorado State University working within the lab of Prof. Steven Simske.

My current research consists in the development of data-driven solutions for identifying and disrupting operations of illicit supply networks. 

I received my Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Mechanical Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). I completed  my Ph.D. also at KIT within the Institute of Automation and Applied Informatics. My Ph.D. research consisted in developing new probabilistic forecasting approaches able to describe the uncertainty of forecast renewable power generation and load.

Research is for me a chance to solve everyday problems, an opportunity to keep learning, and a possibility of contributing to the ever expanding pool of human knowledge.
